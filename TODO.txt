Here come the tasks (for the moment, until a better way to do this is found).

Basics:
[]  Implement the variable assignation
\   []  Equals ( "is" or = )
\   []  Addition ( "plus" or + )
\   []  Subtraction ( "minus" or - )
\   []  Multiplication ( "multiplied by" or * or x )
\   []  Division ( "divided by" or / )
\   Example: TODO
[]  Implement conditions ( "if-then-else"'s )
[]  Create a simple set of webpages, designed as a tutorial
\   []  Some pages should explain what the user can do
\   []  Some pages should explain how a problem should be solved
\   []  Some pages should propose problems, let the user input a solution, verify
\   \   []  If correct, an equivalent code in an existing language should be printed sideways
\   \   \   []  Python2
\   \   \   []  Python3
\   \   \   []  Java
\   \   \   []  C/C++
\   \   \   []  PHP
