Here come the tasks (for the moment, until a better way to do this is found).

Basics:
[X]  Implement the variable assignation
\   [X]  Equals ( "be" or = )

\   [X]  Multiplication ( "multiplied by" or * or x )
\   [X]  Division ( "divided by" or / )
[]  Implement conditions ( "if-then-else"'s )
\   []  Implement equality operator ( "is" or = )
[]  Create a simple set of webpages, designed as a tutorial
\   []  Some pages should explain what the user can do
\   []  Some pages should explain how a problem should be solved
\   []  Some pages should propose problems, let the user input a solution, verify
\   \   []  If correct, an equivalent code in an existing language should be printed sideways
\   \   \   []  Python2
\   \   \   []  Python3
\   \   \   []  Java
\   \   \   []  C/C++
