Simple Educational Natural Programming Language
This small "natural language interpreter" written in Python 2 takes simple sentences such as "let x be 2 plus 3" or "print 'Hooray'" and transforms them into commands that can be executed by a computer.

This interpreter is meant for people which are not familiar with computer programming.
